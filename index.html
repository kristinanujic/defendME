                      <p>
                        A study by Knoema, a world data bank, shows that Spainâ€™s assault rate is 39.2 cases per
                        100,000 inhabitants and the forceful robbery rate is 129.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
                        Both rates apply to the year 2018 but have been increasing over the years. As this study and
                        other studies, articles and reality show, a defense tool is needed in our current time and
                        space as the chance to get assaulted or robbed are very likely. Moreover, during recent
                        years, the number of testimonials of victims of violent and/or sexual assault in the streets or
                        at home or in the workplace have been increasing tremendously. Each day, a new case of
                        assault to a member of a minority group is reported, showing the need for actions that
                        should be taken to avoid these assaults from happening

                        Our concept consists of a product, which is a wearable bracelet that includes basic self defence features like a flashlight, a loud alarm, and a button to call for help, as well as an application for smartphones that connects to the bracelet and enhances the basic features by adding services such as group messaging that creates a community of other DefendMe owners.
